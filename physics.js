LIVED Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much They were the last people youd expect to be in volved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made drills He was a big beefy man with hardly any neck al though he did have a very large mustache Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy any where The Dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it They didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact Mrs Dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away they didnt want Dudley mixing with a child like that When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull gray Tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happen ing all over the country Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window At half past eight Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls Little tyke chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house He got into his car and backed out of number fours drive It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar  a cat reading a map For a second Mr Dursley didnt realize what he had seen  then he jerked his head around to look again There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive but there wasnt a map in sight What could he have been thinking of It must have been a trick of the light Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat It stared back As Mr Durs ley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive  no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day But on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about People in cloaks Mr Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes  the getups you saw on young people He supposed this was some stupid new fashion He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these we" + "irdos standing quite close by They were whis pering excitedly together Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak The nerve of him But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for some thing    yes that would be it The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor If he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning He didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed openmouthed as owl after owl sped over head Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime Mr Dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning He yelled at five different people He made several important tele phone calls and shouted a bit more He was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery Hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers He eyed them angrily as he passed He didnt know why but they made him uneasy This bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin It was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying The Potters thats right thats what I heard   yes their son Harry  Mr Dursley stopped dead Fear flooded him He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it He dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking    no he was being stupid Potter wasnt such an unusual name He was sure there were lots of people called Pot ter who had a son called Harry Come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called Harry Hed never even seen the boy It might have been Harvey Or Harold There was no point in wor rying Mrs Dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister He didnt blame her  if hed had a sister like that    but all the same those people in cloaks    He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door Sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak He didnt seem at all upset at being al most knocked to the ground On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare Dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today Re joice for YouKnowWho has gone at last Even Muggles like your self should be celebrating this happy happy day And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot He had been hugged by a complete stranger He also thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that was He was rattled He hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imagination As he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw  and it didnt improve his mood  was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning It was now sitting on his garden wall He was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes Shoo said Mr Dursley loudly The cat didnt move It just gave him a stern look Was this nor mal cat behavior Mr Dursley wondered Trying to pull himself to gether he let himself into the house He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife Mrs Dursley had had a nice normal day She told him over din ner all about Mrs Next Doors problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word Wont Mr Dursley tried to act normally When Dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news And finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern The newscaster al lowed himself a grin Most mysterious And now over to Jim McGuffin with the weather Going to be any more showers of owls tonight Jim Well Ted said the weatherman I dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today Viewers as far apart as Kent Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early  its not until next week folks But I can promise a wet night tonight Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair Shooting stars all over Britain Owls flying by daylight Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place And a whisper a whisper about the Potters    Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea It was no good Hed have to say something to her He cleared his throat nervously Er  Petunia dear  you havent heard from your sister lately have you As he had expected Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry Af ter all they normally pretended she didnt have a sister No she said sharply Why Funny stuff on the news Mr Dursley mumbled Owls    shooting stars    and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today    So snapped Mrs Dursley Well I just thought    maybe    it was something to do withyouknowher crowd Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name Potter He decided he didnt dare Instead he said as casually as he could Their son  hed be about Dudleys age now wouldnt he I suppose so said Mrs Dursley stiffly Whats his name again Howard isnt it Harry Nasty common name if you ask me Oh yes said Mr Dursley his heart sinking horribly Yes I quite agree He didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front gar den The cat was still there It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something Was he imagining things Could all this have anything to do with the Potters If it did    if it got out that they were related to a pair of  well he didnt think he could bear it The Dursleys got into bed Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind His last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind    He couldnt see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on  he yawned and turned over  it couldnt affect them    How very wrong he was Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness It was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far cor ner of Privet Drive It didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead In fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching ap peared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground The cats tail twitched and its eyes nar rowed Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive He was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt He was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots His blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice This mans name was Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwel come He was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for some thing But he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street For some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him He chuckled and muttered I should have known He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter He flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop He clicked it again  the next lamp flickered into dark ness Twelve times he clicked the PutOuter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him If anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed Mrs Dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement Dumbledore slipped the PutOuter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat He didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to it Fancy seeing you here Professor McGonagall He turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone Instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes She too was wearing a cloak an emerald one Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun She looked distinctly ruffled How did you know it was me she asked My dear Professor Ive never seen a cat sit so stiffly Youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said Professor McGonagall All day When you could have been celebrating I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily Oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently Youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no  even the Mug gles have noticed somethings going on It was on their news She jerked her head back at the Dursleys dark livingroom window I heard it Flocks of owls    shooting stars    Well theyre not completely stupid They were bound to notice something Shoot ing stars down in Kent  Ill bet that was Dedalus Diggle He never had much sense You cant blame them said Dumbledore gently Weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years I know that said Professor McGonagall irritably But thats no reason to lose our heads People are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in Muggle clothes swapping rumors She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but " + "he didnt so she went on A fine thing it would be if on the very day You KnowWho seems to have disappeared at last the Muggles found out about us all I suppose he really has gone Dumbledore It certainly seems so said Dumbledore We have much to be thankful for Would you care for a lemon drop A what A lemon drop Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of No thank you said Professor McGonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops As I say even if YouKnowWho has gone  My dear Professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name All this YouKnowWho nonsense  for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name Voldemort Professor McGonagall flinched but Dum bledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to no tice It all gets so confusing if we keep saying YouKnowWho I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemorts name I know you havent said Professor McGonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring But youre different Everyone knows youre the only one YouKnow oh all right Voldemort was fright ened of You flatter me said Dumbledore calmly Voldemort had powers I will never have Only because youre too  well  noble to use them Its lucky its dark I havent blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around You know what everyones saying About why hes disap peared About what finally stopped him It seemed that Professor McGon" + "agall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now It was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true Dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer What theyre saying she pressed on is that last night Vol demort turned up in Godrics Hollow He went to find the Pot ters The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are  are  that theyre  dead Dumbledore bowed his head Professor McGonagall gasped Lily and James    I cant believe it    I didnt want to believe it    Oh Albus    Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder I know    I know    he said heavily Professor McGonagalls voice trembled as she went on Thats not all Theyre saying he tried to kill the Potters son Harry But  he couldnt He couldnt kill that little boy No one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill Harry Potter Voldemorts power somehow broke  and thats why hes gone Dumbledore nodded glumly Its  its true faltered Professor McGonagall After all hes done    all the people hes killed    he couldnt kill a little boy Its just astounding    of all the things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive We can only guess said Dumbledore We may never know Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it It was a very odd watch It had twelve hands but no numbers in stead little planets were moving around the edge It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said Hagrids late I suppose it was he who told you Id be here by the way Yes said Professor McGonagall And I dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all places Ive come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle Theyre the only family he has left now You dont mean  you cant mean the people who live here cried Professor McGonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four Dumbledore  you cant Ive been watching them all day You couldnt find two people who are less like us And theyve got this son  I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets Harry Potter come and live here Its the best place for him said Dumbledore firmly His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older Ive written them a letter A letter repeated Professor McGonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall Really Dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter These people will never understand him Hell be famous  a legend  I wouldnt be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future  there will be books written about Harry  every child in our world will know his name Exactly said Dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses It would be enough to turn any boys head Famous before he can walk and talk Famous for something he wont even remember Cant you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it Professor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said Yes  yes youre right of course But how is the boy getting here Dumbledore She eyed his cloak sud denly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it Hagrids bringing him You think it  wise  to trust Hagrid with something as im portant as this I would trust Hagrid with my life said Dumbledore Im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said Professor McGonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless He does tend to  what was that A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide He looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild  long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets Hagrid said Dumbledore sounding relieved At last And where did you get that motorcycle Borrowed it Professor Dumbledore sir said the giant climb ing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke Young Sirius Black lent it to me Ive got him sir No problems were there No sir  house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin around He fell asleep as we was flyin over Bristol Dumbledore and Professor " + "McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets Inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a cu riously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall Yes said Dumbledore Hell have that scar forever Couldnt you do something about it Dumbledore Even if I could I wouldnt Scars can come in handy I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Un derground Well  give him here Hagrid  wed better get this over with Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house Could I  could I say goodbye to him sir asked Hagrid He bent his great shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog Shhh hissed Professor McGonagall youll wake the Mug gles Sssorry sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handker chief and burying his face in it But I cccant stand it  Lily an James dead  an poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles  Yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or well be found Professor McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to the other two For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle Hagrids shoulders shook Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out Well said Dumbledore finally thats that Weve no business staying here We may as well go and join the celebrations Yeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice Id best get this bike away Gnight Professor McGonagall  Professor Dumble dore sir Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night I shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall said Dumbledore nodding to her Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street On the corner he stopped and took out the silver PutOuter He clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four Good luck Harry he murmured He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not know ing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs Dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley    He couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices To Harry Potter  the boy who lived");
